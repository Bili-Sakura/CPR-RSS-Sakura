# conference-paper-rss

## Usage

This is a simple repo for improving conference paper reading experience. We try to parse the paper information(title, abstract, url) to all the paper for a certain conference and generate an rss xml file.

### rss source
Use any rss reading client to subscribe to the following rss source.
1. NIPS2018: https://conference-paper-rss.github.io/rss_source/nips2018.xml

## Update plan

1. the support of rss source for cvpr (iccv), eccv will be added recently.
2. the support of generating pdf file instead of xml file will be added recently. 

## Other

1. call for new name (the title `conference-paper-rss' is not very attractive).
2. call for proposal (any suggestion for new conference, or other interesting functions.)
