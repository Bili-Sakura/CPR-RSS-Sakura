# conference-paper-rss

## Usage

This is a simple repo for improving conference paper reading experience. We try to parse the paper information(title, abstract, url) of all the papers for a certain conference and generate an rss xml file.

### rss source
Use any rss reading client to subscribe to the following rss source.
1. NIPS2018: https://conference-paper-rss.github.io/rss_source/nips2018.xml

## Update plan

* [ ] the support of rss source for cvpr (iccv), eccv (they maybe need a pdf-parser to extract the abstract), ICML, ICLR will be added recently.
* [ ] the support of generating pdf file instead of xml file will be added recently. 
* [ ] the support of AAAI, ICJAI, KDD and other top conferences (would need to parse dblp), will be added after 1 and 2.
* [ ] a simple webpage would also be considered if this repo is still alive then.

## Other

1. call for new name (the title `conference-paper-rss' is not very attractive).
2. call for proposals (any suggestion for new conference, or other interesting functions.)
